File _index.md : Contains English content. File _index.vi.md : Contains Vietnamese content.  If you\u0026rsquo;re just writing a Vietnamese guide, you\u0026rsquo;ll copy _index.vi.md to another copy and rename it to _index.md. (For later translation)  Directory static/images   This will be the folder containing the images for the Lab Guide. All pictures are included here. Folders for images can be hierarchical for easy image management.\n  These images will be used in the article with the image tag:\n  ![This is the image name (Displayed when the image cannot be loaded)](/images/2.1/SNAG001.png?width=90pc)  Use ?width=90pc for full screen images and ?width=40pc or ?width=50pc for crop images.  Folder public   This is the directory that will be created by hugo.\n  After writing the complete guide or part of the guide and want to check the display, you can run the following command to build the project\n  $ hugo After the build is completed, a public folder will appear. Run the server to see the results at http://localhost:1313  $ hugo server Here, try to delete the public folder and run the test to see if this Guide works.\n"
